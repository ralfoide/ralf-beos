This directory contains an FFT library which was optimizedfor speed on RISC processors such as the PowerPC.  All fftsuse single precision floats, for double precision just use aglobal search and replace to change float to double in all source files. Optimization was done using a PowerMac 8100/80and a 1024 point complex fft with the CodeWarrier 8 C compiler.fftlib library was created using PPC 604 instruction scheduling.** Warning ** only a small amount of casual testing has beenperformed on this code.  You must perform rigorous testing toyour own standards before using this code. (John Green) green_jt@vsdec.nl.nuwc.navy.milfiles:	fftlib.cLibrary of in-place fast fourier transforms. Contains forward and inverse complex and real transforms.  The real fft's expect thefrequency domain data to have the real part of the fsamp/2 bin (whichhas a 0 imaginary part) to be stored in the location for the imaginarypart of the DC bin (the DC bin of real data is also strictly real.)You must first call an initialization routine (FFTInit for fftsand iffts; rFFTInit for rffts and riffts) before calling the fft computationroutines.  The transforms can be done on either a one dimension array or the rows of a two dimension array.	fftTest.cAn example test program to time the complex ffts on the Macintosh.	rfftTest.cAn example test program to time the real fft on the Macintosh.	fftlibShared library of fftlib.c compiled with CodeWarrier 8 for PPC 604.	fftlib.µCodeWarrier 8 project file to compile fftlib into a shared library.	fftTest.µ and rfftTest.µCodeWarrier 8 project files for the test programs.	ffttest.m and rffttest.mMatlab scripts used to check the results.
